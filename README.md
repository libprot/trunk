Libprot v.0.0.1 Copyright © Alexander Ilin, 2015 year

It is a set of source codes that will help to develop a software protection. 

There is no end solution; this library provides only basic functionality and may 
be modified every time for the current project.   

Your feedback is very important for me. Feel free to contact with me. 

In the current version you may see:

1)	XOR crypt (very basic algorithm to obfuscate data and make it less obvious)
2)	Bin2Hex – to represent binary data as hex (numbers from 0 to 9 and letters 
        from A to F) array
3)	PE Check Sum – recalculate the check sum of a PE file
4)	Example to generate a key and check it validity
5)	Asymmetric algorithm with public and private key
